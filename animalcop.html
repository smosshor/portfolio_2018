						<h2>Animal Cop</h2>
						We just wanted to make it easier for people to report animal abuse, and help the people doing the good work of managing these cases have an easier time. We discovered a world of crazy cat ladies, overworked animal-social workers and nosy neighbors we never imagined.
						<br><br>
						<p>Animal Cop is a digital reporting system for concerned citizens and a management application for Humane Officers, created for the <a href="https://www.humaneanimalrescue.org/">Pittsburgh Humane Animal Rescue</a> shelter using a user-centered design process to create a solution that simplifies the animal abuse reporting and investigation process.</p>
						<p> BHCI Capstone Project, Spring 2017 | Team Animal Cop: Yiran Buckley, Vanessa Kalu, Miranda Nguyen and Maggie Yu. </p>
						<p>I acted as a product manager throughout the project, as well as focusing on the staff research and interface, and supporting Maggie, our engineering lead, with front-end development of the final interactive prototype.</p>

						<p>We were asked to help the Pittsburgh Humane Animal Rescue Shelter address a big problem:</p>
						<p class="italic">How might they both encourage citizens to report animal abuse while also better supporting staff and Humane Officers to handle the cases more efficiently?</p>

						<p>Specifically, they asked for a computer-based system that supports:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Residents in reporting possible abuse</li>
							<li>The shelter’s new Humane Officer (HO) in managing those cases and interacting with other agencies</li>
							<li>Staff who work with animals that may been subject to abuse and who interact with potential offenders and witnesses during intake and adoptions.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Research Insights</h3>
						<div class="row ">
							<div class="col-sm-6 ">
								<h4>The main goal of animal rescue is to educate, not confiscate.</h4>
								<p>Interviewees highlighted cases where they gave many resources to the animal owner rather than confiscating the animal. It is important for HOs to develop <i>cooperative relationships</i> with owners and taking an educational role when possible.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6 ">

								<h4>Laws are complicated and don’t match people’s assumptions.</h4>
								<p>Citizens misunderstand cruelty laws, make inappropriate complaints, and report to the wrong agencies. When citizens’ misunderstanding of laws impacts their reporting behaviors, valuable time and resources are wasted for all parties involved.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 ">
								<h4>Misreporting can have serious consequences for the organization, people, and animals involved.</h4>
								<p>HOs and shelters have limited resources but numerous cases. Malicious, incorrect, or unspecific reports strain an already burdened officers. Misreporting is a serious problem for prioritization and investigation.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 ">
								<h4>Animal rescue operations are collaborative and co-dependent.</h4>
								<p>Instances of animal abuse can coincide with other crimes. Because  of this, cases requires various agencies (e.g. Animal Control, HOs, Pittsburgh Police) to work together. Breakdowns can occur in terms of communication and cooperation.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 ">
								<h4>Animal rescue is like social work; it involves people, not just animals.</h4>
								<p>We found that animal abuse can occur due to altercations between people (i.e. a domestic incident results in the harm of a pet). Furthermore, false reporting can occur to defame an individual. Social behavior cannot be taken out of the equation when thinking about animal rescue.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 ">
								<h4>For citizen reporters, lack of feedback after reporting is frustrating and disheartening.</h4>
								<p>Citizens who report abuse are very emotionally attached and strive to understand if their actions actually impact the situation. Currently there are no follow-ups mechanisms. Reporters may become disheartened and discouraged from future reporting.</p>
